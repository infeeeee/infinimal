This is version 3.0, you don't have to install the font, I figured out how can be included in the theme. 
The Tw Cen MT Condensed font is the property of Microsoft, if somebody asks, you got it when you bought office 2007, this was included. If you didn't own office, please delete the font, and buy it from microsoft.

How to use the HWINFO plugin?
You will need update the HWiNFO IDs included in this skin to match the IDs for your system.  To do this:
1 - ensure HWiNFO is running, with sensors and shared memory active
2 - run the included "HWiNFOSharedMemoryViewer.exe" file in the @Resources\Plugins folder
3 - find the sensor reading you need (CPU Usage for example) and make note of the sensor id, sensor instance and entry id
4 - edit the Variables.inc file in the @Resources folder to replace the provided IDs with the IDs for your system
5 - refresh all skins

The original HWiNFO.inc is included in the @resources\Plugins folder, however not used anywhere, just for reference.

VGA and VRM skins are HWinfo only.
